One string distance measure is *edit distance*, in particular *Levenshtein* distance. The idea is to compute the cost of editing one string into another by deleting (*d*), inserting (*i*) or substituting (*s*) letters. The minimum edit distance, i.e. the lowest cost of editing one string into the other, determines string similarity. Here is an example from the book.\n",
